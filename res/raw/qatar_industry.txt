<b><u>INDUSTRY :</u></b>
Within short period of time, the State of Qatar has made great strides in all fields of economy especially the industrial ones. 
Oil revenues have been well utilized to establish a solid base for oil and gas related industries and other basic industries,
and build an advanced infrastructure capable of serving national industries and responding to its future needs and challenges.
The Ministry of Industry and Energy works to build a strong industrial base, import industrial products, diversify national
income sources and increase the contribution of the industrial sector in the gross domestic product (GDP) with a view
to achieve a balanced economic growth aside from oil revenues. The Ministry of Industry and Energy has adopted several goals
that include developing and supporting industrial sector to diversify sources of national income; increasing the added value
of intermediary materials; encouraging the private sector to increase its contribution to industrial development;
increasing the contribution of manufacturing industries sector to the GDP, encouraging and supporting high energy consuming
industries and clean industries; enhancing the integration between industrial, oil and gas and other economic sectors; and 
finally achieving the highest possible level of integration between various industrial sectors . 

<b><u>INDUSTRIES :</u></b>
The state of Qatar adopts the policy of diversifying income sources and achieving stable economic growth through optimizing the
utilization of its natural resources by developing the north gas field and petrochemicals, steel and refining
industries. The state succeeded in a record time to establish and operate those industries until Qatar became the main
producer of LNG and other petroleum products; and that would lead to more revenues and push the march of social and economic development
in the country forward. Qatar has achieved the best quality standards of performance and cost reduction on a par with similar industries
in the developed countries.

<b>Swearing by God who up raised the sky,
Swearing by God who spread the light,

Qatar will always be free,
Elevated by the spirits of the loyal,

Follow the path of the ancestors,
And the prophets guidance.

In my heart, Qatar is an epic of dignity and glory,

Qatar is the land of the forefathers,
Our protectors at the time of war,

Doves at the time of peace,
And hawks at the time of sacrifice.</b>

<u><b>Qatar 2022</u></b>
Winning the bid for the FIFA World Cup 2020 was only one part of the game. Qatar is currently preparing itself to welcome a global audience into its home for one of the most widely-attended events in the world. Qatar is undergoing a complete infrastructural makeover to cater to a global audience.

These infrastructural projects include the building and development of existing facilities such as stadiums, roads and freeways, an extensive railway network, housing projects, hotels, malls and even the brand new Hamad International Airport. Each of these will be world-class facilities that will offer an unparalleled quality of services. 

<u><b>Qatar’s preparation for World Cup 2022 </u></b>
<b>STADIUMS</b>
Many new stadiums will be built to accommodate a large number of spectators from all over the world. For the ease and comfort of both spectators and players, air conditioning units will be installed across all stadiums. A number of existing stadiums will be developed to accommodate a larger number of spectators than is possible at present. This will be made possible by installing modular seats, which can be removed or retained after the 2022 World Cup tournament.

<u><b>Qatar Integrated Railway Project</u></b>
One of Qatar’s primary goals is to develop an extensive railway network which would serve residents of Qatar in moving from one place to another locally as well as a long distance rail service which would increase mobility of passengers between Qatar and its neighbour Saudi Arabia.
Qatar Rail is developing a world-class efficient public transportation system, which will consist of three main services:
•	Doha Metro
•	Long Distance
•	Light Rail Transit
 
<b>Doha Metro</b>
The Doha Metro is an important part of Qatar Rail Development Program (QRDP), and will be divided into four lines spread across 216 kilometres and approximately 100 stations. The Metro will cover Greater Doha area and will include connections to different parts of the country, including residential and commercial areas. While the Metro will be underground in central Doha, it will be above ground on the outskirts and other areas.
It will be divided into four routes: Red Line (Coast Line), Green Line (Education Line), Gold Line (Historic Line) and Blue Line (City Line).
 
<b>Long Distance Passenger and Freight Rail</b>
The long distance rail network is planned over a length of approximately 510 kilometres. The QRDP plans to develop a long distance rail network that will carry passengers between Qatar and its neighbouring GCC states Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain.
Such a long distance travel option would help not only to reduce carbon emissions and keep travel eco-friendly but it is certainly a faster way to travel across the country as well as to other nearby states without having to go through the hassles of traffic.
 
<b>Lusail Light Rail Transit</b>
This new rail transit system will be located across Lusail City, the waterfront city located at the north of Doha will extend across 35 sq. km. of land and will be one of the largest developments around the world. To build an entire community in itself, it will encompass not just residential, commercial and retail opportunities but also other facilities for residents such as schools, medical facilities, entertainment and shopping centres.
This transit system will consist of four lines, 25 stations including four at Marina District, one at Entertainment City, one at Energy City, one at Qatar Petroleum District and one at the Pearl Doha station.

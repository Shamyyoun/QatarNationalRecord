On June 25, 2013, HH Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, came to power after HH the Father Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, stepped down, in a step seen by many as a precedent in the Arab region and in the whole world. Voluntarily relinquishing control by a ruler at the peak of his power, success and achievements in this manner, was a precedent. The initiative taken by HH the Father Emir in transferring the reins of power to HH Sheikh Tamim in this honoring manner was a milestone of civilized governance in the Arab world, unlike the traditional way, where the will of people is not respected.

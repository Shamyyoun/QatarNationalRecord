<b><u>Historical Overview :</u></b>
Human habitation of the Qatar Peninsula dates far back to nearly four thousand years BC,
according to archaeological evidences, excavations, inscriptions and scarce potteries found in various areas of the country. 

In the 5th century BC, the Greek historian Herodotus referred that the first dwellers of Qatar were the Canaanite tribes,
who were known for their navigation and naval commerce. Furthermore, the Greek geographer Ptolemyâ€™s so-called Map of Arabia
included as well what Ptolemy himself then called â€œQatraâ€�, which is thought to be a reference to the Zubara city, being
previously one of the most important commercial ports in the Gulf area.

Qatar played a vital role as narrated by the Arab-Muslim historical sources. The Qatari dwellers involved themselves in
preparing the first naval fleet to transport armies during the Muslim conquests. 

Under the Abbasid rule during the eighth Hijri century (14th AD), Qatar witnessed a period of economic prosperity as
made evident by the written records found in the Maroub Fort on the western coast that represents the Abbasid architectural
character.

Upon their military alliance with the Turks during the tenth Hijri century (16th AD), the Qataris could drive the
Portuguese away, and that was the beginning of the rule of the Ottoman Empire over the whole Arabian Peninsula including Qatar
for about four successive centuries.

The Turkish rule in the region, however, declined with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and a treaty was entered with
Britain in 1916 providing for the protection of the Qatari lands and people. The British authority was restricted mostly
to its supervision on some administrative affairs.

Qatar was ruled by the Al-Thani Dynasty, after its leader Thani bin Mohammad â€” father of Sheikh Mohammad bin Thani,
who was the first sheikh later on to have an actual power over the Qatari Peninsula during the mid-nineteenth century.

Being a descendent of the Bani Tameem Tribe with their ancestral lineage dating back to Mudhar bin Nizar, the Al-Thanis settled
on the Jibrin Oasis in the south of Nejd prior to their movement to the north of the Qatari Peninsula. Then, 
they moved to Doha in the mid nineteenth century under the leadership of Sheikh Mohammad bin Thani.
